Send email only on Reply to My Comment: will give users the option to receive email alert only when someone replies to their comment.

== Description ==
Send email only on Reply to My Comment: is a simple plugin that will give your site visitors the option to receive email notification if someone replies to their comment. But the email will only be sent to one person, that is, the original commenter to whom the new user is replying.

For this plugin to work, you will need to enable Threaded/Nested comments option.
